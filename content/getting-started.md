[fluxo.dev](/) is a website that is a "public journal" of sorts, logging our exploratory journey
into the wilderness of artificial intelligence. Though we do expect to meander, our stated mission
is to build a *scalable distributed neural network*, along with a suitable *interface* --- that is,
a language --- for interacting meaningfully with the network. We'll discover what this actually
means and refine the underlying ideas over time.

Going forward, we will post updates on progress and reports on special topics as they arise. For
today, I leave you with this wonderful little piece sung by [Bilbo
Baggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins) in *The Lord of the Rings*.

> The Road goes ever on and on  
> Down from the door where it began.  
> Now far ahead the Road has gone,  
> And I must follow, if I can,  
> Pursuing it with eager feet,  
> Until it joins some larger way  
> Where many paths and errands meet.  
> And whither then? I cannot say.
